# Septimus-Extended---LOTD Addon (OPEN BETA)

# Introduction

Hello! This addon will integration Legacy of the Dragonborn into the world of Septimus-ified Skyrim. This will be a **manual process** with various steps involving downloading, rearranging, etc. A provided megapatch will be available at the end of the guide.

A **NEW SAVE is REQUIRED**. It's impossible to install LOTD on an existing save as it adds way too many things!

# Installation

First of all, we're going to right-click on the left side of MO2 and highlight the "All Mods" option, then click the dropdown of "Create separator above". We'll call it **[NoDelete] SEPTIMUS EXTENDED - LOTD**. All of the following mods will be installed under this separator, and the separator itself will go just below the separator called "THE DANGER ZONE". 

All the plugins going forward will be at the very bottom, **below all of the Septimus patches**. The .esm files will need to be dragged to the top, just above **EVGAnimatedTraversal.esl**.

1.) Download [Legacy of the Dragonborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11802?tab=files).
   - Drag the file into your downloads folder where you have the rest of your Septimus mods downloaded. Refresh MO2. Below the drop-down menu where you usually launch Septimus, there should be a series of tabs titled "Plugins | Archives | Data | Saves | **Downloads**". Click the Downloads tab, and sort by "Filetime". Legacy of the Dragonborn should be right at the top. If it isn't, sort by Filetime again and it will flip the downloads to most recent.
