# Eldryn-Extended---HD Quests Addon

![Image 0](https://i.imgur.com/t7FcCDv.png)

# Introduction

Hello! This addon will integrate new HD textures from various quests into the world of Eldryn-ified Skyrim. This will be a **manual process** with various steps involving downloading, rearranging, etc. **There will not be a patch for reran LODS.** Your LODS will be like the main game, lower res. **You will need at LEAST 20 GB of available space to download this addon.**

You can install this on an **EXISTING SAVE**.

**Currently designed to work with version 1.3.2 of Eldryn.** A changelog is provided at the bottom.

# Installation

First, we will right-click on the left side of MO2 and highlight the "All Mods" option, then click the dropdown of "Create separator above". We'll call it **[NoDelete] [02.000] ELDRYN EXTENDED - HD QUESTS ADDON**. All of the following mods will be installed under this separator, and the separator itself will go just below the separator called "THE DANGER ZONE". 

All the plugins going forward will be at the very bottom, **BELOW all of the Eldryn patches** but **BEFORE DynDOLOD.esp**.

Screenshots are available at the bottom of this page to compare as you go.

### Then you are SET! Thanks for sticking with it the entire process, enjoy your game!

# Addon Compatibility

   - **Currently works with [Eldryn-Extended---HDT-SMP Armor Addon](https://github.com/Foamimi/Eldryn-Extended---HDT-SMP-Armor-Addon/blob/main/README.md).** Due to the nature of how we numbered everything, the HDT-SMP Armor Addon will load before the HD Quests Addon.

# Last Steps

   - Here's how the Mod Name tab on the **left side of MO2** should look:

   - Drag the following **.esl** files along the right side of MO2 to the very top, directly ABOVE **DynDOLOD.esm**.

   - Then here's how the Plugin tab on the **right side of MO2** should look for the remainder of **.esps**:

# Changelog

**IMPORTANT** - If updating Eldryn (like from v.1.0.1 to 1.0.2 for example) your load order may become a bit funky on the right side of MO2. Luckily we numbered everything while installing, so the left side of MO2 should still be intact, but to get everything back in position for the right side, I'd suggest disabling the entire HD Quests addon, then re-enabling everything again one by one. This takes a hot second, but I find this method to be the fastest (for me anyway!).

**Eldryn v1.3.2**
  - Release.
