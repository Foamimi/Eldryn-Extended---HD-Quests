# Septimus-Extended---TEXTURES ADDON

![Image 0]()

# Introduction

Hello! This addon will integrate new HD textures into the world of Septimus-ified Skyrim. This will be a **manual process** with various steps involving downloading, rearranging, etc. A series of megapatches will be provided at the end of the guide.

Works on **EXISTING SAVES**.

# Installation

First of all, we're going to right-click on the left side of MO2 and highlight the "All Mods" option, then click the dropdown of "Create separator above". We'll call it **[NoDelete] SEPTIMUS EXTENDED - TEXTURES**. All of the following mods will be installed under this separator, and the separator itself will go just below the separator called "THE DANGER ZONE". 

All the plugins going forward will be at the very bottom, **below all of the Septimus patches**.

# Changelog

**IMPORTANT** - If updating Septimus (like from v.1.0.1 to 1.0.2 for example) your load order may become a bit funky on the right side of MO2. Luckily we numbered everything while installing, so the left side of MO2 should still be in tact, but to get everything back in position for the right side, I'd suggest disabling the entire series of Texture addons, then re-enabling everything again one by one. This takes a hot second, but I find this method to be the fastest (for me anyway!).
